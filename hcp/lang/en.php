                            Hyperbilirubinemia is an excessive accumulation of bilirubin in the blood, characterized by jaundice, yellowish discoloration of the skin, sclera and nails. 
                            In newborns, the lifespan of red blood cells is shorter than in adults, which makes a lot of bilirubin, the function of enzymes to conjugate bilirubin is poor, 
                            and the function of removing bilirubin from the body is also weak.',
    'faq_question2' => 'Why is phototherapy for jaundice important?',
    'faq_answer2' => 'Phototherapy is based on the use of light to convert unconjugated bilirubin molecules into water-soluble isomers that can be excreted in the bile or urine without conjugation.
                            Bilirubin absorbs light most strongly in the blue region of the spectrum near 485 nm, a region where tissue penetration of light increases sharply with increasing wavelength.
                            Only wavelengths that penetrate and are absorbed by bilirubin have a phototherapeutic effect. Light specifically in the blue region of the spectrum from 470 to 490 nm is probably most effective in treating hyperbilirubinemia.',

                            However, conventional phototherapy requires parents to be separated from their babies so that exclusive breastfeeding for babies is hampered. Apart from that, the price of phototherapy equipment in circulation reaches 200 to 300 million,

                Phototherapy has been widely recognized as an effective method for lowering unconjugated bilirubin levels. While various phototherapy devices are commercially available, traditional phototherapy often necessitates the separation of infants from their parents, disrupting exclusive breastfeeding.

In Indonesia midwives, general practitioners (GPs), and pediatricians are involved in the care of jaundiced newborn infants. It is unknown whether the high incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia in this country is related to a lack of awareness of existing hyperbilirubinemia guidelines issued by, for example, the World Health Organization, the American Academy of Pediatrics, or the Indonesian Health Ministry, or to a lack of adherence to such guidelines.
