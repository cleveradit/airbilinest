    'faq_answer1' => ' Hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice is a major problem related to newborns today, accounting for 60-80% of infants hospitalized in the first 7 days of life with the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity. 
                            Severe hyperbilirubinemia is the 5th leading cause of child death in Indonesia based on Riskesdas 2020. This can actually be prevented with early diagnosis and standardized therapy.

                            Hyperbilirubinemia is an excessive accumulation of bilirubin in the blood, characterized by jaundice, yellowish discoloration of the skin, sclera and nails. 
                            In newborns, the lifespan of red blood cells is shorter than in adults, which makes a lot of bilirubin, the function of enzymes to conjugate bilirubin is poor, 
                            and the function of removing bilirubin from the body is also weak.',
    'faq_question2' => 'Why is phototherapy for jaundice important?',
    'faq_answer2' => ' Phototherapy is based on the use of light to convert unconjugated bilirubin molecules into water-soluble isomers that can be excreted in the bile or urine without conjugation.
                            Bilirubin absorbs light most strongly in the blue region of the spectrum near 485 nm, a region where tissue penetration of light increases sharply with increasing wavelength.
                            Only wavelengths that penetrate and are absorbed by bilirubin have a phototherapeutic effect. Light specifically in the blue region of the spectrum from 470 to 490 nm is probably most effective in treating hyperbilirubinemia.
